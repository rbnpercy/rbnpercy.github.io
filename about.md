Hi there!  I'm Robin; a software engineer, developer educator and long-serving developer advocate.  Currently, I am focused on **developer education, technical content and marketing** for a range of industries.  This includes technical tutorials, blog posts, and  documentation development for developer-focused products.  Most recently, I have been building developer portals and education centres for Crypto companies such as ***Bancor***, and ***Kyn***.

My software career started in 2007 when I left school and started a business crafting custom websites and software for small clients in the North of England.  From that business, the opportunity to move to London arose, to merge with another digital agency.

In 2011, alongside 4 others, I bootstrapped the "World's first social gambling website" - Bodugi.com.  After serving as CTO, I left Bodugi in 2012 to enter the world of Developer Relations.  Sitting behind a desk all day long was leaving me restless, and I was super jealous of my friend who was already working as a Developer Evangelist, so I left the gambling industry to work in Dev Rel, initially at [Couchbase](https://blog.couchbase.com/?s=robin+johnson), as their first European Evangelist, and one of the first Developer Evangelists in England.

After spending a year as a Developer Evangelist at Couchbase, I moved on to working as a *Senior Developer Evangelist* at [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/blog/author/rbin).

Developer education and developer experience are the most important fields in my career, as well as my passion.  For as long as I've been in the software industry, sharing knowledge has been the most important factor to me.  There really is nothing I enjoy more than educating and empowering other Developers, and enabling them to create fantastic software through the use of excellent tooling.  Be it through hosting interactive or in-person lessons, creating video tutorials, or my personal favourite; creating Technical Content.

Teaching was, and always will be, my favourite part of working in Developer Relations.

At the back-end of 2015, I left SendGrid to found another startup.  This time, it was Luno.io.  An API-based User Management SaaS built by Devs, for Devs.  Luno.io got accepted into, and graduated from the [Ignite Accelerator Programme](http://ignite.io/#programmes) in London for 2015/16.  After raising a small round of funding, I continued at Luno until August 2016, when we folded the business due to personal reasons between the founders.

From August 2016, I have been freelance Technical Writing for a multitude of tech companies.  Technical Writing was always my favourite form of sharing and the best part of my job.  I take **great** pleasure in exploring new technologies, hacking together sample applications and documenting exactly how I did so.  Technical blogs / tutorials are *my* preferred way of learning about a new piece of tech, and producing those tutorials for other Developers is my passion.  Writing API documentation is also another firm favourite of mine.

For technology topics, my specialities are APIs, Crypto, AI, Security, Databases, Distributed Systems, Erlang/Elixir, Golang, Ruby/Rails, and Crystal Lang.

In November 2018, I had a serious accident leading to the unfortunate loss of my right leg.  As a lifetime Rugby player and mountain climber, being active has **always** been an important part of my life.  Due to my disability, I can no longer travel the amounts required to stay on as a Developer Evangelist, so I now require a (preferably) remote role in Developer Education.  (Technical writing, Documentation development, Workshop hosting etc.)

I have worked every day since I was 16 years old, and I will not let my disability change that.  Working is my life passion.
